### SVG icon collection for building HTML UIs

This project aims to bring together SVG icons from a variety of open-source projects, along with some we have created ourselves, to provide a functional, consistent icon set for use in HCMC web projects.

Icons will be stored as individual SVG files, and an Ant build process will generate useful products in the form of sprite files containing all or a specified selection of icons, convenient browsing interfaces, and anything else that turns out to be useful.
